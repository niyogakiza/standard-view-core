# Standard View Core

# Usage

Install

```
$ npm install @standard/standard-view-core
```

Make sure you are logged into the company npm account.
You may login with `npm login` and provide the npm credentials or acquire the npm token from 1Password (Engineering Team Vault).

Place Views into your React App. For example:

```
import { View3D, Box } from '@standard/standard-view';
.
.
.
<View3D>
  <Box position={[1, 0, 0]} color="green" />
  <Box position={[-1, 0, 0]} color="red" />
</View3D>
```

For details about valid properties, look at the interfaces named `*Props`, where `*` is the component name, in `src/primitves/` and `src/groups/`.

## Mesh

All Standard View primitives are composed within `Mesh`,
with the exception of `Line`, `BoundingBox`, `Text`, and `Group`.
Therefore, properties of `Mesh` are common to nearly alll components.
Here is a list of explicitly managed `Mesh` properties in Standard View:

Mesh Properties

- position: Array\<number\>
- scale: Array\<number\>
- rotation: Array\<number\>
- quaternion: Array\<number\>

Material Properties

- color: string
- hoverColor: string
- opacity: number
- texturePath: string
- textureURL: string
- material: THREE.Material

Geometry Properties

- wireframe: boolean
- side: number
- geometry: THREE.Geometry

Animation Properties

- animation: Function
- state: Object

Event Properties

- onClick: Function
- onDoubleClick: Function
- onWheel: Function
- onPointerUp: Function
- onPointerDown: Function
- onPointerOver: Function
- onPointerOut: Function
- onPointerMove: Function

`Mesh` can also support animations via the animation property. A function with one argument that may be destructured to include `state`, `setState`, `mesh`, and any Canvas properties desired for the animation.
All primitives and shapes may have animation. These animations are reactive, so they incur many render calls, but also maintain `react-three-renderer`'s native raycasting for the event property functions.

`Mesh` also exposes `react-three-fiber`'s the event property functions but with a constrained argument set, similar to animation. All event property functions take one arguement that may be destructured to include `mesh`, `state`, `setState`, and any Canvas prop. The benefit of this design, just like animations, is that a reference to `mesh` is automatically provided. Moreover, `react-three-fiber`'s `Canvas` state properties are exposed. This allows event functions to reach right into the `react-three-fiber`/`three.js`'s `scene`, `camera`, `gl`, etc. Hence all shapes that are `Mesh`s may have these event property functions.

Of course, `Mesh` can accept properties handled by `react-three-fiber`/`three.js` as well.
After explicitly managing these properties, remaining properties are passed to `react-three-fiber`'s `mesh`.
(`Mesh` is a wrapper of `react-three-fiber`'s `mesh`, which is a wrapper of `THREE.Mesh`.)

## View3D

Here is a list of explicitly managed `View3D` properties in Standard View:

WebGLRenderer Properties

- background: string

Camera Control Properties

- trackballControls: boolean
- orbitControls: boolean
- mapControls: boolean

Of course, `View3D` can accept `Canvas` properties handled by `react-three-fiber` as well. The Standard View properties are handled and stripped away before passing the properties to `Canvas`.
(`View3D` is a wrapper of `react-three-fiber`'s `Canvas`.)

## Text

`Text` in Standard View is composed within a `Mesh`. So `Text` may accept all the same properties as a `Mesh`. `Text` also should have a `text` property with the desired string to be displayed and also a `font` or `fontName`. `font`s are typeface.json fonts and must be a `THREE.Font`. The default `three.js` fonts are also included in Standard View, so simply passing `fontName` with one of those fonts will work.

Fonts

- helvetiker
- helvetikerBold
- optimer
- optimerBold
- gentilis
- gentilisBold

In general `Text` will be much more computation expensive to render compared to `Label` which is just a `Plane` with a texture of the desired text.
